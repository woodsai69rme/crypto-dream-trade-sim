# üîÑ MULTI-ACCOUNT TRADE FOLLOWING SYSTEM - AUDIT & FIXES 2025

## üìã AUDIT OVERVIEW
**Date**: January 14, 2025  
**System Version**: 2.1.0  
**Audit Type**: Critical Fixes & Performance Review  

## üö® CRITICAL ISSUES FIXED

### 1. TypeScript Errors in Deribit Integration
**Issue**: `S.unrealized_pnl is undefined` and type mismatch errors
**Root Cause**: Improper JSON serialization and null handling
**Fix Applied**:
- Added proper null coalescing for `unrealized_pnl` fields
- Fixed JSON serialization in `saveCredentials` function
- Added proper TypeScript typing for database operations

### 2. Deribit Settings Not Persisting
**Issue**: User credentials not saving to database
**Root Cause**: Incorrect data structure passed to Supabase
**Fix Applied**:
- Implemented proper JSON stringification before database storage
- Added error handling and user feedback for save operations
- Enhanced credential loading with proper type casting

### 3. Multi-Account Trade Following System Issues
**Issue**: Synchronized trading not staying active across sessions
**Root Cause**: Missing state persistence and improper signal processing
**Fix Applied**:
- Added localStorage persistence for following state
- Implemented proper account-specific confidence thresholds
- Enhanced staggered execution with proper delay mechanisms
- Added comprehensive logging for trade execution tracking
