## VERIFICATION AFTER EACH PHASE

Always run these checks after implementing any continuation prompt:

1. **System Health**: Check all accounts are active and trading
2. **Performance**: Verify analytics are updating correctly
3. **Risk Management**: Confirm safety measures are operational
4. **Audit Trail**: Ensure all activities are being logged
5. **User Interface**: Test all dashboard functionality

## CUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS

Each prompt can be modified with these parameters:
- **Account Focus**: Specify which accounts to enhance
- **Asset Selection**: Choose specific cryptocurrencies
- **Risk Level**: Adjust conservative/aggressive settings
- **Time Horizon**: Set short-term vs long-term optimization
- **Integration Scope**: Select specific exchanges or APIs
